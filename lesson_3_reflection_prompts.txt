1. When would you want to use a remote repository than keeping all your work local?
    I would want a remote repository if I would work on an open source project

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automativally stay up-to-
   date with your remote repository?
    I might want to do this manually, because I may have things that I don't want to keep up-to-date.
    With manual changes I have full control I choose what I want.

3. Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    clone: my own copy of a repository
    fork: same as clone, but online on github
    branch: a path of a repository

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    With the last known state of the remote I can always see where I come from.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    I would show my changes to the others and explain them. If there are any questions or bugs, I can work
    on these direct. But the others need to have some free time for me.
    With Git or GitHub I could upload them and they check it, when they have the time for that. But it takes
    longer if there were any questions or bugs in my code.

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What
   benefits does each approach have?
    When you make changes in a separate branch it does not destroy the original branch. If everything is
    correct you can merge it in the master branch.
