1. When would you want to use a remote repository than keeping all your work local?
    I would want a remote repository if I would work on an open source project

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automativally stay up-to-
   date with your remote repository?
    I might want to do this manually, because I may have things that I don't want to keep up-to-date.
    With manual changes I have full control I choose what I want.
