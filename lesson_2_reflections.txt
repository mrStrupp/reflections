1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    When you initialize a repository Git creates a folder, where it saves the history of the commits.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you
   think it offers?
    With the staging area you can choose what files you want to add to the commit, if you worked on
    different things in different files, but did not commit, you can still separate it.
